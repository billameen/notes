# Basic Data Modeling

## Choosing Attributes
### Calculated Data
- avoid data that can be calculated
	- ex. age â†’ store birthdays instead, age changes each year
### Break Down Complex Values
- ex. dont store the entire address as a string, store the individual parts of the address so it is easier to query

### Allocate Appropriate Precision
- ex. don't store zip codes using 200 characters, you only need at most 10
- ex. don't store a year using 100 characters, you only need 4
- This makes thinks more efficient, in terms of both query speed and global storage

# Cardinality
- How many things are related to other things

## One-to-one

## One-to-many

## Many-to-many
![[Pasted image 20250323232210.png]]
- Allows books to have multiple authors and authors having multiple books

- This many-to-many relationship has attributes
- in this case, the reservation has properties to describe the guest-room relationship

![[Pasted image 20250323232308.png]]
- This allows multiple guests on the same reservation
- allows multiple rooms per reservation and multiple guests per reservation

## Recursive Relationships

- Categories and subcategories
